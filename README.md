#Agile and Beyond 2014 Notes

##Venue

##Communication and Marketing

This was a bit of a hot mess in 2013, and I'll take some of the blame here.  For 2014 I'm going to revamp the website to get away from the Wordpress site and creat a dynamic services based site that allows:

###Website

  - Integrated email system with Mailchimp
  - A RESTFul service that allows for the delivery of the schedule in json format to help feed the web and mobile apps simetanously
  - A speaker dashboard and mangment system.

  - Sponsor admin dashboard will also be automated and filled out by the sponsors online.
  - Possible direct integration with Eventbrite
  - develop mobile apps sooner
  	- include twitter integration, autogenerate tag for each session.
  	- include survey information
  	- photo integration
  	- compare with SXSWEdu app (it was awesome)
